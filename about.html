        <div class="about-card">
            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Abhirup Mukherjee, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student with a strong desire to bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world applications. Currently pursuing my degree at Techno India University, I have developed a keen interest in web development, programming, and data-driven problem solving.</p>
            <p>My toolkit includes a variety of programming languages like Python, C, C++, and Java, along with hands-on experience in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I love building projects that solve real problems, like the hospital webpage I developed to manage patient records and appointments efficiently.</p>
            <p>What excites me most is the intersection of technology and creativity. I am always exploring new challenges, whether it's designing responsive websites, creating interactive applications, or contributing to open-source projects on GitHub.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I believe in teamwork, leadership, and the power of emotional intelligence to drive innovation and success. Looking forward to making meaningful contributions in the tech space and collaborating with like-minded professionals!</p>
